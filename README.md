# forbes_2000
In this project, I use the a dataset featuring a list of companies by its rank, name, country, category, sales, profits, assets, 
and market value in the year 2000. The initial goal of the analysis is to create visualizations of correlation tables.
Please, feel free to contribute to this project.
Thanks
